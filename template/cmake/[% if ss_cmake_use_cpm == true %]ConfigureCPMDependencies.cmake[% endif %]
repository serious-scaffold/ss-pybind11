Use CPM to add dependencies to the project.

CPM is CMake's missing package manager. A small CMake script for setup-free,
cross-platform, reproducible dependency management.

See https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake.

Example:

  # add executable
  add_executable(main main.cpp)

  # add dependencies using cpm module
  CPMAddPackage("gh:fmtlib/fmt#7.1.3")
  CPMAddPackage("gh:nlohmann/json@3.10.5")
  CPMAddPackage("gh:catchorg/Catch2@3.2.1")

  # link dependencies
  target_link_libraries(main fmt::fmt nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json Catch2::Catch2WithMain)

Note:
  Use cmake-cpm/CPM will break up the project dependency management of vcpkg. Best practice
  to use this when the project would not be built as a shared library to be referred by
  other vcpkg projects.
