Use conan to add dependencies to the project.

conan is a CMake wrapper for conan C and C++ package manager.

See https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan.

Example:

  conan_cmake_configure(REQUIRES fmt/6.1.2
                        GENERATORS cmake_find_package)

  conan_cmake_autodetect(settings)

  conan_cmake_install(PATH_OR_REFERENCE .
                      BUILD missing
                      REMOTE conancenter
                      SETTINGS ${settings})

  find_package(fmt)

  add_executable(main main.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(main fmt::fmt)

Note:
  Use cmake-conan/conan will break up the project dependency management of vcpkg. Best practice
  to use this when the project would not be built as a shared library to be referred by
  other vcpkg projects.
